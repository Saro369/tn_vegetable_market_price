## Project Description

The TamilNadu Vegetable Price Prediction project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to forecast the prices of vegetables in Tamil Nadu. The goal is to provide accurate predictions that can assist various stakeholders in making informed decisions related to vegetable trading, production planning, and consumer purchasing.

The project involves collecting historical data on vegetable prices, including factors such as date, vegetable type, region, and price. This dataset serves as the basis for training the prediction model. Several machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks, are employed to develop the prediction model. The model learns from the historical data patterns and correlations to make predictions on future prices.

The project also involves data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to ensure the data is in a suitable format for training the model. Exploratory data analysis may be conducted to gain insights into the dataset and identify any relevant trends or patterns.

## Installation

To install and run the TamilNadu Vegetable Price Prediction project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/username/tamilnadu-vegetable-price-prediction.git
   $ cd tamilnadu-vegetable-price-prediction
   ```

2. Set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```shell
   $ python3 -m venv env
   $ source env/bin/activate
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Obtain the historical dataset of Tamil Nadu vegetable prices. This dataset can be sourced from government agricultural departments, open data initiatives, or other relevant sources.

4. Preprocess the dataset, perform feature engineering, and split the data into training and testing sets.

5. Train the prediction model using machine learning algorithms of your choice.

6. Use the trained model to make predictions on future vegetable prices.

## Usage

To use the TamilNadu Vegetable Price Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have completed the installation steps mentioned above.

2. Run the prediction script or execute the Jupyter Notebook file to load the trained model and make predictions on new data.

3. Provide the necessary input data, such as the vegetable type, date, and other relevant features, to the prediction module.

4. The prediction module will utilize the trained model to generate price predictions for the specified vegetable.

5. Analyze and interpret the prediction results to gain insights into the future price trends of vegetables in Tamil Nadu.
